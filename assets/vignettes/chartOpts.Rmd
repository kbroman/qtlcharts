There are a number of ways in which one may wish to customize the
interactive graphs produced by
[R/qtlcharts](https://kbroman.org/qtlcharts/), such as different
colors or axis labels. Our main approach to allow such customization
is through a function argument, `chartOpts`.

Use of these options is described in the
[R/qtlcharts User Guide](https://kbroman.org/qtlcharts/assets/vignettes/userGuide.html).

The following is a listing of the customization options for each
chart. You can also use the chart option `caption` to provide a
caption for the chart. (The `caption` option is mostly intended for
stand-alone html files.)
